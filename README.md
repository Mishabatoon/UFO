# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project
This Project is a webpage of UFO Sighthings and will allow you to filter based on multiple criterias:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

The data was stored in `data.js` and in order to produce this webpage we used `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, and `CSS`.


## Results
Dana can use a webpage just like `index.html` to drill down her searches depending on which criteria she is looking for.

For starters, go to the Filter Search and enter the specific information that you are looking for. You can either enter one information for one criteria or enter information on multiple criterias for a more detailed and thorough search.

When you click enter the result will automatically show on the table next to the Filter Search Bar. For this example, it is showing UFO Sightings for 1/1/2010.

## Summary

One drawback that I see is the lack of data that we have. It only has data for January 2010 UFO Sightings. Also, it would be nice to have a link or an image that shows each UFO sighting result. Another recommendation is to have an "advanced search" where it let you filter more than one information for each criteria. Let say, I want to filter all UFO sightings between 1/1/2010 to 3/31/2010.  The ability to filter a date range would be a great addition to the webpage.
